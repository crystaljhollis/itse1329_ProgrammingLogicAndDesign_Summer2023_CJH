//Name: Crystal Hollis | Assignment Name: 05.2 Bar Chart | Date: 8/9/2023

//Assignment: Bar Chart
//Write a program that asks the user to enter today‚Äôs sales for five stores.
//The program should display a bar chart comparing each store‚Äôs sales.
//Create each bar in the bar chart by displaying a row of asterisks.
//Each asterisk should represent $100 of sales.

//Criteria:
//Functionality: correctly asks user to enter today's sales for five stores and displays a bar chart comparing
//each store's sales. Should not use scanner class or arrays
//Code Quality: Well-organized, easy to read, variable names descriptive, comments explain code necessary
//User Interface: clear and easy to understand, prompts user for input, bar chart well-formatted and easy to read
//Creativity: creatively designed and visually appealing, goes beyond basic requirements, engaging experience
